This I/O library has been created in order to facilitate my daily job. I have always liked the letter "p", so I decided to call it "pio".

This library makes use of several other libraries, such as leveldb and c-acers.

This package is not aimed to be cross-platform. It will be tested only on Linux and Mac systems.
